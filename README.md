# Digit-Recognizer
## This is a Kaggle Comprtition

### This competition is the perfect introduction to techniques like computer vision and neural networks using a classic dataset including pre-extracted features.
### In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. Weâ€™ve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.

## Practice Skills
**Computer vision fundamentals including simple neural networks**

**Classification methods such as SVM and K-nearest neighbors**
